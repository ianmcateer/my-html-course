# Semantics

So we know that HTML tags are used to format content. These tags tell the browser how to display content on the web page. But they give no indication of what type of content or what role that content plays on teh screen.

HTML5 introduced specific tags that indicate clearly what role is being played by the content those tags contain. This helps search engines better understand what content is important.

So basically Semantic elements are elements with meaning.

Some elements are not semantic and dont have meaning, while others are. 

## The elements that are not semantic

```
<div>
<span>
```

These are examples of non-semantic elements. They serve only to convey to the browser how the content should be displayed. They give no informaation about the role their content plays on the screen.

## Which elements are semantic in HTML?

```
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>
    <form>
```

We will learn about these sematic elements later in the course. 

## Why should i use HTML5 tags?

For sighted users, it is easier to identify parts of the website. Headers, menus and main content are easy to see and navigate.

But for non sighted users as well as search engines it makes it difficult to understand the website without being able to understand the meaning to the content inside. If you can successfully ocmmnuitcate what part of the website is the most important content then you can give them an explicit instruction to prioritize that content.
