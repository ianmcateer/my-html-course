# HTML Attributes

- an attribute provides some addiitonal information about an element

for example
```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

This a tag here is a link element. The link address is specified with the href attribute. You will learn more about a tags and links later in this course. But without this addiitonal information, our link wouldnt work. 

- all html elements can have atributes 
- they usually come in name/value pairs like name="value"
